# 👋 About Me:

Hey There, I’m Fyza!
  
I'm a recent graduate of a coding bootcamp at School of Code, who is keen to get a career kick-started as a full stack developer!

My GitHub profile reflects my progress in coding journey, starting from simple exercises to larger apps. I hope that it's showcases my coding development, It's been tempting to adjust and edit old code but I think the imperfection is important in showcasing my growth which I hope all developers can find common ground with.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on developing projects and a portfolio!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, travel, food, gaming, sports, writing to name a few!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source coding projects & learn more about software development
  
# 📝 Tech Blog:

I'm documenting my progress in a public diary, a quick website sharing my journey, projects and how I feel doing it! Please give it a read, it's my take on the 100 days of code challenge!
